# CryptoPy (progressing...)
CryptoPy is a Python project that demonstrates classical cryptography algorithms, starting with the Caesar cipher, with plans to add more ciphers (e.g., Vigenère, Affine, Substitution).
# Some of these will be included
1. Caesar Cipher: Encode and decode messages with customizable shift keys

# Features

🖥️ Interactive UI (Tkinter) to visualize how encryption & decryption works step by step

📜 Clean Python implementation, beginner‑friendly and easy to extend


# Built with:
Python, Tkinter

# 💡Contributions and suggestions are welcome as the project grows!
